# Material browser free plugin for SketchUp

Search for SketchUp materials by name from three sources: active model, local collections, and Poly Haven. Filter materials by type (Ceramic, Wood, etc). Select material of your choice in one click. Increase thumbnail up to 256px.

If you use SketchUp 2025 or newer, [Photoreal materials](https://help.sketchup.com/en/release-notes/sketchup-desktop-20250#photoreal) are supported, once you select a material from Poly Haven, Material Browser plugin will download and set all textures maps for you: AO, Diffuse, Metal, Normal GL, and Rough.

### Can I bring my own materials?

Yes, this plugin does support custom materials as *.skm* files.

1. Open a model containing some of your materials.
2. Access SketchUp "Materials" tray.
3. Right-click on one of your materials then select "Save as".
4. Select a folder or subfolder to save this one as a *.skm* file.
5. Repeat previous steps with all your materials.  
6. In Material Browser, click on "SKM folder" icon at left.
